A Trie (pronounced "try") is a special type of tree data structure used primarily for storing strings, where each node represents a single character of the string. It is often called a prefix tree because it is very efficient at searching and storing prefixes of words.

**Key Features of a Trie:**
  -Nodes for Each Character:
    Each node in the trie represents a character of the string.
    The path from the root to any node forms a prefix of some string in the dataset.
  -Root Node:
    The trie starts with a root node, which is typically empty. From this root, each subsequent level corresponds to characters in strings.
  -Edge Represents a Character:
    Each edge between nodes corresponds to a character in a string.
  -Leaves for Complete Words:
    Leaf nodes can represent the end of a word or string.
