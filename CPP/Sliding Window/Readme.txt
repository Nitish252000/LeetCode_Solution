The sliding window concept is a useful technique in computer science, particularly for solving problems that involve arrays or lists. It is used to maintain a subset of elements within a larger set, dynamically adjusting which elements are included in the subset as you process the set. This technique is efficient for solving problems related to subarrays or sublists, especially when trying to find the maximum, minimum, or specific properties of subarrays.

Concept of Sliding Window:
The sliding window approach involves two pointers, usually referred to as left and right, which represent the boundaries of the current window. The window "slides" over the array, either expanding by moving the right pointer or contracting by moving the left pointer, to maintain a subset of elements that satisfies certain conditions.

**How It Works:**
Initialization: Start with both pointers at the beginning of the array (or window of size zero).
Expand the Window: Move the right pointer to include more elements in the window.
Check Condition: Evaluate if the current window meets the desired condition.
Shrink the Window: If the condition is violated, move the left pointer to exclude elements from the window until the condition is satisfied again.
Track Results: Throughout this process, keep track of the best (e.g., maximum or minimum) result encountered that satisfies the condition.
